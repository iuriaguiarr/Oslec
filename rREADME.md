# Oslec Technology

Service call system developed in JavaScript during an activity of the Database discipline at SENAI Cimatec.
It consists of two levels of users:
* Customers
* Operators

Customers create tickets, and operators can accept or decline them. After accepting them, their status stops to be "Progress", which allows the conclusion of the same.

The name "Oslec" is a tribute to the teacher's name. If you reverse the order of the letters, the result will be Celso.

## For this project the following technologies were used:
* React: For creating interfaces;
* Axios: For communication with the server;
* Material UI: For the stylization of interfaces.
* React-Toastify: For the issue of errors.
* Express: For backend routing;
* Knex: For the management of the Database;
* Nodemon: To start the server:
* SQLite3: Database.

## Installation and Usage
